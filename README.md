# Challenging the Status Quo of Diversification: An Analysis of Returns by Asset Class

# Team Members

- Lindsey Hardouin
- Jacob Rougeau
- Tony Landero
- Youssouf Ouologuem

# Project Description

The project team will analyze whether funds comprised of a single asset class (crypto, real-estate, equity, bonds, commodities,  etc.) out-perform a diversified portfolio.  


# Research Questions to Answer

1. Is there a particular asset class that delivers more returns than the others? (Challenging the time-tested diversified portfolio strategy)

2.  Does time affect returns by asset class?  I.e. Is crypto a better short-term investment while real-estate a better long-term investment?
